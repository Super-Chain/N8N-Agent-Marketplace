# AI Agent Marketplace

A modern, embeddable agent marketplace that allows developers to integrate prebuilt n8n agents into their applications. Built with Flask and featuring a beautiful, responsive UI inspired by modern design principles.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Pre-built N8N Workflows**: Browse and deploy specialized n8n workflows for various automation tasks
- üéØ **Easy Deployment**: Direct deployment to your n8n instance without credential storage
- üîç **Smart Search**: Filter workflows by category, trending status, or search terms
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- üöÄ **My Workflows**: Manage your uploaded and deployed workflows in one place
- üìä **Real-time Configuration**: Configure credentials and deploy workflows instantly
- üîó **n8n Compatible**: Designed to work seamlessly with n8n workflow automation
- üîí **Secure Credential Handling**: User API keys are transmitted once during deployment and never stored server-side
- üì§ **Workflow Upload**: Upload your own n8n workflows and manage them alongside marketplace templates

## Workflow Categories

- **Data Processing**: Extract and transform data from various sources
- **AI/ML Integration**: OpenAI, Claude, and other AI service integrations
- **Google Services**: Google Sheets, Drive, Gmail automation
- **Communications**: Telegram, Slack, email processing
- **HTTP APIs**: Custom API integrations and web service connections
- **File Management**: Process CSV, PDF, and other file formats
- **Productivity**: Calendar, scheduling, and task management

## Key Concepts

### Workflow Sources
- **Marketplace Templates**: Pre-built workflows imported from n8n.io or community templates
- **User Uploads**: Custom workflows uploaded directly by users via JSON files

### My Workflows
- Central place to manage all your workflows (uploaded and marketplace)
- View workflow details, credentials required, and deployment status
- Configure credentials and deploy directly to your n8n instance
- Track which workflows are active in your n8n setup

### Credential Management
- Credentials are collected in the UI but never stored server-side
- Transmitted securely once during deployment to configure your n8n instance
- Each service (OpenAI, Google, etc.) creates separate credential entries in n8n
- Supports OAuth2, API keys, and basic authentication patterns

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agent_marketplace
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables** (optional)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Setting Up Your N8N Instance

Before using the marketplace, ensure you have:

1. **N8N Instance**: A running n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
2. **API Access**: N8N API key with workflow and credential creation permissions
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set `N8N_BASE_URL` and `X_N8N_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

### Browsing and Deploying Workflows

1. **Browse Marketplace**: Visit the homepage to see all available workflows
2. **Search and Filter**: Use the search bar and category filters to find specific workflows
3. **Upload Custom Workflows**: Use "Upload Workflow" to add your own n8n JSON files
4. **View My Workflows**: Access all your workflows (uploaded and marketplace) in one place

### Deploying a Workflow

1. **Select Workflow**: Choose from marketplace templates or your uploaded workflows
2. **Configure Credentials**: Fill in required API keys and service credentials
   - OpenAI API keys for AI-powered nodes
   - Google OAuth2 credentials for Google services
   - Service-specific tokens and keys
3. **Deploy**: Click deploy to create the workflow in your n8n instance
   - Workflow name is automatically extracted from the workflow JSON
   - Deployed workflows are saved to both database tables for better organization
   - Duplicate deployments are automatically detected and prevented
4. **Manage**: View and manage deployed workflows in both your "My Workflows" section and n8n dashboard

### Credential Configuration Examples

## Core Components

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **app.py**: Main application with REST API endpoints for workflow management, authentication, and deployment
- **database.py**: Supabase integration for user profiles, workflow storage, and deployment tracking
- **n8n_workflow_parser.py**: Analyzes n8n workflows to extract credential requirements and generate configuration forms

### Frontend (HTML/JS)
- **workflows.html**: Single-page application for browsing, uploading, and managing workflows
- **workflow-credentials.js**: Interactive credential configuration forms with validation and testing

### Database Schema
- **user_profiles**: User authentication and n8n instance configuration
- **user_workflows**: User-uploaded workflows and marketplace subscriptions
- **n8n_workflows**: Marketplace workflow templates and metadata
- **workflow_deployments**: Tracking of deployed workflows and their status

## Development

### Adding New Marketplace Workflows

1. **Import from n8n.io**: Use the import endpoint to fetch templates from n8n community
2. **Upload Custom Templates**: Add pre-built workflows via the admin interface
3. **Metadata Configuration**: Set workflow descriptions, categories, and credential requirements

### Extending Credential Support

1. **Update Parser**: Add new service mappings in `n8n_workflow_parser.py`
2. **API Integration**: Extend credential creation logic in `create_credentials_in_n8n()`
3. **UI Forms**: Add custom field types in `workflow-credentials.js`

### Database Management

- **Dual Storage**: Deployed workflows are saved to both `n8n_workflows` (marketplace tracking) and `user_workflows` (personal management)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic checks prevent duplicate workflow deployments
- **Migrations**: Use Supabase SQL editor for schema changes
- **RLS Policies**: Ensure Row Level Security for user data isolation
- **Indexing**: Optimize queries for workflow search and filtering

### Testing Workflows

1. **Local n8n**: Set up local n8n instance for development
2. **Credential Testing**: Verify credential creation and workflow deployment
3. **Parser Validation**: Test workflow analysis with various n8n JSON formats
